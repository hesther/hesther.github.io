Did you wonder what the doodle on the landing page is about?

It comprises some of my favorite molecules. In dark gray, $$\beta$$-Pinene, is a terpene made out of two isoprene units, with a pine-like smell. It is released by some forest trees. Another terpene, geraniol, is shown in light gray in the background, and is a component of rose scent. There are more than 30,000 terpens known, most of them produced by plants, and they have an astonishing palette of biological functions. I love being out and about, enjoying nature, and the scent of flowers or trees is definitely part of the experience. I also love coming home to the smell of freshly baked cinnamon buns, which owe their scent to cinnamon aldehyde, shown in medium gray. Interesting molecules are all around us!
