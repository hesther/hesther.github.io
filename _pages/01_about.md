<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I am a passionate and always curious scientist, teacher and mentor. 
My main areas of research comprise various aspects of <b>computational chemistry</b>, i.e. the simulation, prediction
and optimization of chemical processes on the computer.

<div style="text-align: justify"> 
I currently work on machine-learned reaction property prediction, employing 
principles of <b>graph theory</b>, <b>cheminformatics</b>
and <b>deep learning</b> to better understand chemical reactions, and to develop new computational approaches toward eco-friendly synthesis of diverse target
molecules in the long term.
I am furthermore a <b>software developer</b> and maintainer, for example for a Python package that predicts molecule and
reaction properties using graph-convolutional neural networks.
Other areas of expertise comprise the <b>computer simulation</b> of soft matter and the <b>quantum-mechanical calculation</b> of various molecular and atomic properties.
