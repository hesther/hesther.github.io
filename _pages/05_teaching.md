I am a passionate, motivated and engaging teacher, inspiring students to get interested in the taught topic, actively participate in the course and earn good grades. I am able to explain difficult concepts intelligibly and compellingly, structure a course logically, create a welcoming classroom atmosphere, treat students with respect, and strive towards equity, fairness and diversity. I strongly believe that excellent teaching is important and necessary to raise new generations of top-qualified researchers.
